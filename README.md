# Object-detection-and-Obstacle-avoidance-using-Yolo-V5
Our project develops an environment with objects maze and several real time objects A bot moves in a maze and avoids obstacles and detects the objects of Environment using Yolov5 algorithm.YOLOv5 is a popular object detection algorithm that builds upon the previous versions of YOLO (You Only Look Once). It was developed by Ultralytics and introduced in 2020. YOLOv5 improves upon its predecessors by focusing on accuracy and speed, making it suitable for real-time object detection tasks.
